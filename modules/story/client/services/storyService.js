                pre: "Mackenzie is the daughter and first born child of Jeff and Dawn Oscar. She was born on March 26, 1990, which happened to be the night of Oscar Awards. So, of course, the family took great delight in delivering the FIRST \"Oscar\" of the evening and played it up in typical \"Oscar\" fashion with a party and balloons."+"She was the most beautiful baby at birth. She had lots of dark hair and olive skin with not a new born mark on her. Instantly we could tell she had the coloring of her poppy, Paul Oscar, who had olive skin and dark eyebrows."+"As a first born child, she was definite, determined, scheduled and feisty. She loved keeping busy and kept everyone around her busy taking care of her every whim. The funny thing is, all that changed as she matured. She became a servant; someone always interested in serving others and helping friends through difficult times. She had a real desire to figure out her relationship and commitment to God, so going to church and getting involved became a huge part of her life. "+"She went to Seattle Pacific University and majored in European Studies: French and rowed on the crew team where she went to the NCAA Nationals as a sophomore and was able to be a part of the men’s team’s successes her senior year as the men’s coxswain. Upon graduation, she accepted a job in the corporate world working in human resources and has been loving it ever since.",
                one: "Jonathan is the son and first born child of Ron and Linda Pyke. He was born on February 5th, 1992. As he grew, it was clear that he loved to learn and try new things. He loved playing with cars and trucks and enjoyed reading books. Once he was old enough to ride a bike, he learned how to ride them quickly and loved the newfound freedom of getting around the driveway and, in due time, the neighborhood."+"He also loved being mom and dad’s little helper, and quickly learned about tools and how to use them. Whenever he got a new toy, he would play with it as intended, but then soon move on to testing the limits of it. If it rolled, how fast could it go? If it bounced, how high? If it came apart, what was inside and how did it work? This always amused the family and they came to see that this was all part of how he was wired."+"In middle school and high school he was able to feed the little engineer in him on the Robotics team and then again in college on the UW Formula SAE team. He will be graduating soon from the University of Washington with a major in Mechanical Engineering and concluding his education as a design engineering intern at Genie Industries.",
                two: "They went to high school together, but they didn’t run in the same circles. He knew who she was and found her mysterious. She, on the other hand, was completely oblivious to his existence."+"After Mackenzie’s junior year of college and Jonathan’s freshman year, they meet at Crossroads Bible Church’s college group. She’s attending Seattle Pacific University, and every Sunday she commutes across the lake to attend church and spend time with friends afterward. Finally, they’re running in the same circles, and she begins to realize that Jonathan’s quite a guy—charming and grounded, someone she considers the \“calm to her storm.\” He thinks she’s spontaneous and fun, and loves a partner for adventure. By the time the New Year rolls around, they’re hanging out one-on-one."+"On March 31st, 2012, Jonathan takes Mackenzie out on their first date. They go to dinner, then spend hours in conversation as they walk around Green Lake. Jonathan makes some unfortunate attempts to speak French and Mackenzie corrects his accent, completely charmed by his efforts. Their conversation continues over a warm cup of coffee and concludes with a trip to Kerry Park, where they gaze out at the Seattle night skyline. He asks her to be his girlfriend and they begin dating. Mackenzie’s weeks are a whirlwind of school, crew and struggling to get enough sleep, and Jonathan’s busy with school, too, but he drives to SPU from Bellevue every weekend so they can spend time together. After graduating, Mackenzie gets her first apartment in the U-District, just minutes away from Jonathan’s house. Hallelujah!",
                three: "The week before Jonathan proposes, he reschedules their upcoming date. Mackenzie assumes that there’s no way he’s proposing that night. \“He wouldn’t reschedule,\” she thinks. \“He’s way too much of a planner to do that.\” It’s February 1st, 2014. He takes what she thought to be a strange route to Gasworks Park, and that’s when she starts to suspect something. They walk to the large hill to watch the sunset, and as they’re sitting on their blanket, Jonathan, earnest and teary-eyed, pops the question. Mackenzie’s in shock—she can’t believe it’s really happening. Naturally, she accepts. They celebrate with dinner at her favorite Italian restaurant, followed by dessert, her favorite meal, on the pier.",
                four: "Come join us on Whidbey Island to celebrate! After you RSVP, you’ll receive an email with the full details."
